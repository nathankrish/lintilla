## Design goals

- Low cost wireless
  - xiao ble is only $10 per controller compared to $25 for the nice!nano
  - Reversible PCB for the cheapest manufacturing option (I ordered a set of 5 boards, the minimum order, for under $10)
  - Big battery and an option for a dongle, so you can [run for months without recharging][batteryestimate]
- Ergonomic design for the ultimate comfort
  - split keyboard means you can place each half where it best works for you
  - keys are placed where (my) fingers at rest naturally fall
    - when fingers extend, they splay, so the keys also splay outward to follow the fingers
    - the pinky is shorter than the other fingers, so the pinky keys are placed lower to match
    - unlike most ergonomic boards, the thumb doesn't have to tuck below the palm to reach the thumb keys
  - includes all source files, so if your fingers are slightly different, with a little work you can adjust the keyboard to fit you exactly
- Low profile 3D printable case
  - case is only 7mm high and each side comes in two separate pieces, each largely flat on one side for easy FDM printing with minimal fuss
  - bumpons are inset into the case 1mm to minimize their height; they add only 1/2mm in height
  - choc v1 hotswap switches are some of the shortest commonly available
- Hotswappable
  - keycaps and switches can be easily removed and exchanged so you can fine tune the feel
  - the case is designed to hold tight to the switches, while offering a switch-puller groove that allows for safe and easy removal
- Electrostatic protection
  - unlike other ultra-low-profile cases, no electronics are exposed on either the bottom or the top of the case
  - on the side of the case, the reset button and power switch are available, and the usb port is accessible

Once you have these items, you can follow the instructions in the [Build Guide][buildguide].

## Firmware

After you build the keyboard, you will need the [ZMK firmware][firmware].

## What's this about a dongle?

The Lintilla keyboard, with its [LED indicator][rgbled], is perfectly capable of running without a dongle.
With a 250mah battery, the central half should last about 2 months between charges, and the peripheral about 4-6 months.

Some people prefer to use a [dongle][dongle], though, both to allow both halves to last longer between recharging,
as well as to provide additional feedback on the battery and bluetooth status and currently active layer and modifiers.

I have tested the Lintilla with the following dongles, though you should be able to get any ZMK-compatible dongle to work with it:

- The fancy [Prospector Dongle][prospector]
- The more traditional [OLED Dongle][oled]

Note that while the Lintilla keyboard uses the XIAO BLE as its processor, you can use any bluetooth-capable ZMK-compatible processor
on the dongle. If you found a dongle you like, but it uses the nice!nano processor, for example, it should work just fine with Lintilla.
